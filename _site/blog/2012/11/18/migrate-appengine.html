      <!-- CONTENT -->
      <p>When I decided to learn Python, I figured a great way to host my small demo site would be Google App Engine. I used this platform in the past to host Java applications and had experience with Google’s deployment method. After <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/" title="following these steps to locally launch my Python app">following these steps to locally launch my Python app</a> I tried to deploy it to an existing app ID that I set up earlier for a Java app, but no longer used. The deployment error I got was this:</p>

<pre class="wide">
The 'python27' runtime is only supported for apps using the High Replication Datastore.
</pre>

<p>The reason for this error is because this specific app id is not created as a High Replication Datastore. <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/migration">Google provides these steps to upgrade</a>, but if you are using 10/10 of your free app slots, then you will not be able to duplicate the application. In my case, I did not need to retain the old data, so <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/applicationsettings#Disable_or_Delete_Your_Application">completely deleting my application</a> was the best solution. Then I just created a new one with a new appID.</p>
