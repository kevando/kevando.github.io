If a movie doesn't capture my attention within the first five minutes, I turn it off. I adopted this approach from <a class="external" href="https://youtu.be/Bw9P_ZXWDJU?t=2789" target="_blank">
Yuval Noah Harari who does the same thing with books.</a> He gives books only ten pages. I love it.

Before I selected Frances Ha from Netflix, I burned through 4 movies. Frances Ha is black and white movie with zero indicators that I'd like it. It captured my attention within the first five minutes. Within thirty minutes I cried. Come to think of it, I cried during the last five movies I watched. I'll consider that solid evidence my approach works.

Written by and starring Greta Gerwig (she directed the Little Women reboot). It has <a class="external" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frances_ha_2013" target="_blank">92% Rotten Tomatoes.</a> My favorite scene is when he asks how to get to Chuggins.
