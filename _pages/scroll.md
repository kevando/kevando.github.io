Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby

Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know

That something wasn't right here?

Oh, baby, baby, I shouldn't have let you go

And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me how you want it to be

Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killing me (And I)

I must confess I still believe (Still believe)

When I'm not with you I lose my mind

Give me a sign, scroll me baby one more time

Oh, baby, baby, the reason I breathe is you

Boy, you got me blinded
Oh, pretty baby, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, scroll me baby one more time
Oh, baby, baby
Oh-oh
Oh, baby, baby
Eh-eh-yeah
Oh, baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here, and give me a sign
scroll me baby one more time
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign, scroll me baby one more time
I must confess that my loneliness is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here, and give me a sign
scroll me baby one more time
