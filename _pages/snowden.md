"Nothing says more about a person than the books that they prize because these are the ideas they embody. I'm a reader, but Iâ€™m also a child of the internet. Iâ€™m part of that first generation who grew up connected. Who could reach out and see anything. And this means I didnâ€™t just read books. I read from a book that never ends. We are writing a book together. All the time. All of these different communities. We are the authors of a new story, one that reaches every [human heart](/empathy) in every corner of the earth.
