# Control Your Attention

The battle for your attention is now a

There is no longer a battle for your attention. It is war.

# Our Attention War



### Spotify is in the data business, not music. They track you and use *your data* to power a very sophisticated A.I. system. All for the purpose of manipuluating you into giving them more of your attention.

### It's a battle and you must fight to retain control of your attention. Losing the battle is a lobotomy. 

### It is time to fight back

<br>

### [Submit a request to get your data from Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy?utm_source=kevando+up+in+this+motherfucker)

<br>

`shots fired`

<br>

### They were ready and immediately return fire. You get an email within seconds asking you to confirm your request you just confirmed. They always double check when something is not in their interests. 

### Click to confirm and defeat them in the first of many battles. The war is long.

### Next they will test your resolve by laying siege. Spotify makes you wait several days to get your data. Data that is rightfullly yours. You'll know they surrendered when you get white flag email. 

## The battle continues. 

This email contains a link to download a zip file that contains your Spotify data. They deliver your data as JSON, a file format only computers can read. You are not a computer. Time to call for reinforcements. 


Send me the zip file via email. I will turn your JSON data into a spreadsheet (like this) and a ven diagram that shows where our music taste overlaps.

<br> 

We will win.


Your attention battle is our attention war.
