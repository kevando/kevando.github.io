# Download Your Spotify Data

<hr>

Spotify is in the data business, not the music business. The most valuable data is your data. Spotify tracks you and then manipulates you without your knowledge. Follow these instructions to fight back.

## Request Your Data 

### [spotify.com/us/account/privacy/](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy?utm_source=kevando+up+in+this+motherfucker)

<br><br>

They will send an email double checking you want your data. Click confirm and defeat them in battle.

They test your resolve by making you wait several days. Eventually they surrender and raise a white flag. Another email arrives.

This email contains a link to download a zip file that contains your Spotify data. They fight back by sending your data in JSON.  These are files meant for computers, not humans. Call for reinforcements!

# 📞

<br>

Send me the file named `YourLibrary.json` (or the the whole zip file via email) and I make your data readable.

If you don't know my email, message me on Twitter [@kevando_](https://twitter.com/kevando_)

Together we will defeat a system that wants to control your attention.
