## Step 3

*Wait*

<br>

## Step 4

You'll get an email with a zip file containing a bunch of json files. DO NOT SHARE THEM. They contain pretty sensitive information about you. 

<br> 

## Step 5 

Send me `YourLibrary.json` If you know how to read a json file I'm actually only interested in the `Arists` array. You could also probably convert this to a Google Sheet pretty easily. I could probably add a file submit option here.
