# Download Your Spotify Data

<hr class="red">

Spotify is in the data business, not the music business. The most valuable data is your data. Spotify tracks you and then manipulates you without your knowledge. Follow these instructions to fight back.


<br><br>

### Request your data here: [spotify.com/us/account/privacy/](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy?utm_source=kevando+up+in+this+motherfucker)

<br>

They will send an email to double check that you're actually fighting back. Click to confirm and defeat them in battle.

Next they will test your resolve by making you wait. The seige lasts several days until they raise a white flag and relinquish what is rightfully yours. Their email of surrender contains a link to download a zip file that contains your Spotify data. The fighting continues.

They deliver your data as JSON, a file format only computers can read. You are not a computer. Call for reinforcements. 

<br>

Send me the zip file and I make your data readable. All I really want is the `YourLibarary.json` file to see where our music interests overlap.

<br> 

Together we will defeat a system that wants to control your attention.
