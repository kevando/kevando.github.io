It contains a link to download a zip file that contains your Spotify data. You "Spotify data" is a bunch of json files.  These files contain pretty sensitive information about you. <b><font color="red">DO NOT SHARE!</font></b> Except with me of course. 

<br>

Send me the file named `YourLibrary.json` or the the whole zip file via email. If you don't know my email, message me on Twitter [@kevando_](https://twitter.com/kevando_) I will put your data into a spreadsheet and send that to you :) 

<br> 

Together we will dismantle the system of oppression.
