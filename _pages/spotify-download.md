# Download Your Spotify Data

<hr class="red">

### Spotify is in the data business, not the music business. The most valuable data is your data, and Spotify tracks you to get it. They feed your data into powerful A.I. that recommends ways to manipulate you. All without your knowledge. 

# Follow these instructions to fight back.

<br>

## Step 1: [Request your data](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy?utm_source=kevando+up+in+this+motherfucker)

<br>

`shots fired`

<br>

They were ready and immediately return fire with an email asking you to confirm your request. Click to confirm to defeat them. 

The battle is not over. 

Next they test your resolve by laying siege and making you wait several days before surrending your data.  The data that is rightfullly yours. Their white flag is another email. 

The battle continues. 

This email contains a link to download a zip file that contains your Spotify data. The fighting continues.

They deliver your data as JSON, a file format only computers can read. You are not a computer. Call for reinforcements. 

<br>

Send me the zip file and I make your data readable. All I really want is the `YourLibarary.json` file to see where our music interests overlap.

<br> 

Together we will defeat a system that wants to control your attention.
