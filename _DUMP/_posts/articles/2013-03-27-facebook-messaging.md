At the end of the day, Facebook will survive because of its messaging service. They offer one key factor that no other messaging service provides. Not even email.

### The **Reply-All opt out.**

Nothing kills an email thread faster than when I reply all. But with Facebook group messaging, you don't have to wait for my response. They let you&nbsp;voluntarily&nbsp;leave the conversation. This single feature will keep Facebook in the game for a very long time.&nbsp;
