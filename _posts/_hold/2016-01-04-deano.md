This morning I took a long walk through the woods with a dear old friend that I had not seen for over 4 years.  We talked about our life goals and what it means to be a “good person.” He is a man of faith and it surprised me how closely our philosophies aligned.

We discussed the importance of loving yourself and filling yourself with compassion. We deduced that one’s only goal in life should be to fill yourself up with so much compassion for yourself, that it overflows toward your fellow man.

Choose to light your path with compassion and love.
