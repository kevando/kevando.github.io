When I worked with [@af_design](https://twitter.com/af_design "twitter"), we often argued the effectiveness of infinite scroll on web sites.&nbsp;Apparently&nbsp;my rants did not persuade him,&nbsp;because&nbsp;this morning he sent me a link to [Why Infinite Scroll did not work for Etsy.](http://www.usabilitypost.com/2013/01/07/when-infinite-scroll-doesnt-work/ "etsy infinite scroll")&nbsp;When&nbsp;I considered dismissing the article, our other UX&nbsp;colleague&nbsp;[@scholfieldesign](https://twitter.com/schofieldesign "twitter")&nbsp;chimed&nbsp;in. **So what's this about?**

Etsy did no research and assumed their users would benefit from infinite scroll. Right on! Their team implemented the feature only to find that&nbsp;infinite&nbsp;scroll actually _decreased_ user engagement. [Dan McKinley explains it here.](http://mcfunley.com/design-for-continuous-experimentation "video talk")&nbsp;

While he does a&nbsp;thorough&nbsp;job explaining why the experiment failed, I still think there other variables are at play (besides potential browser issues). &nbsp;For example -- a user goes 8 "pages" deep, clicks on a product, and then hits the back button. Not likely they'll return to their previous search page (as you see happen with Twitter and Facebook). [Svpply](https://svpply.com/shop?search=iphone%20cases "svpply") solves this with lightbox product view pages (similar to Twitter profile pages) and then opens the product in a new window.&nbsp;

Am I so crazy to think people deserve a choice in how their search results get displayed?

#### Etsy lets you _sort_ how you want

#### Etsy even lets you _view_ your results how you want.

Why not let users also pick infinite scroll if they want? I mean, you already developed it.&nbsp;I just searched&nbsp;['iphone cases' sorted by most recent giving me 153,445 results.](http://www.etsy.com/search/handmade?q=iphone+cases&order=date_desc&view_type=gallery&ship_to=ZZ&page=0 "etsy")&nbsp;They all look great, but if you think I'm gonna paginate 1,250 pages you're nuts.
