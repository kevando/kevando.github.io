##### I like using Slack to communicate on large teams and here's a short list of some of the tricks I learned that make Slack more useful. 


The [Slack Help Center](https://get.slack.help) is awesome and you should go there now if you haven't. Get to know your [#general Channel](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/220105027-The-general-channel) for some good insight into your team. Every new member joins #general by default.
 

 <h3>Notifications</h3>
 <p>The key to using Slack effectively is good interuption management. You can configure notifications based on device, by channel, keywords, @here. Slack has a <a href="https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201355156-Guide-to-Slack-notifications-#channel-specific-group-dm-notifications">guide to notifications</a> that is worth reading. Also be concious of who you're alerting when sending messages.</p>


 We've come a long way since the dial up days.  When AOL Instant Messenger and 56k modems were the standard, chatting online was different. You had to block one communication device (home phone) to enable another. Today — we're overloaded with alerts. Some apps even alert you if the person is *about* to send a message. We use tiny pocket sized super computers to send brand new technology like GIFs (I guess some things don't change).

**Slack is a pretty amazing solution compared to what we had.** I've seen 3 articles weighing pros and cons of Slack and I want to weigh in on the dialog they created and try to frame the problem in my own words and propose 1 next step. Steven shared [Is group chat making you sweat?](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/) and we discussed the good and bad of Slack. Jason shared [The productivity pit: how Slack is ruining work](https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/1/18511575/productivity-slack-google-microsoft-facebook) and we drilled in to *how we use slack.* George shared [You don’t understand your software engineers](https://medium.com/@amandoabreu/you-dont-understand-your-software-engineers-53442ca0805a) and we discussed the tone. I can't tell if we're getting somewhere. Feels like we are.
