<!-- # üåû we meet -->


The story of how I started my Frameri Eyewear begins with an email. It was the summer of 2013 and I was living in Chicago when  saw the subject line: 

*"You have a new message in your founder2be.com inbox"* 

I thought to myself oh wonderful, someone else wants to pitch me their lame busines idea. That's all I ever received from this website. I'll give the site one more chance I thought. It said "Hey I'm in Chicago this weekend, let's grab beers and I'll tell you about the eyewear company I want to start." It began one when my co-founder Konrad and I met on one of those entrepeneur dating websites. He was lookin for a techncal co-founder, I was looking for a non-technical co-founder. A perfect match. 

<!-- We got accepted into [The Brandery](https://www.mainstventures.org/brandery-portfolio), a summer long tech accelerator based in Cincinati. I figured worst case scenario it completely flops and I meet some cool people. Easy decision. I made great lifelong friends and event the dog I lived became famous. -->

# üçÇ 2013

The Brandery program was awesome and when it ended in the fall of 2013 we had some traction (and money) so we moved forward with  crowd funding campaign. We launched a crowdfunding campaign on [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/frameri-one-lens-many-frames) because Kickstarter did not allow eyewear. The campaigned raised $63,000 and gave us confidence people wanted our product. 


# üåû 2014
 <!-- **2014** -->

We officially launched the company on July 29, 2014 when our [Techcrunch article dropped](https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/29/frameri-eyes-up-warby-parker-launches-eyewear-with-interchangeable-lenses). We were the cool kid in school and everyone likes the cool kid. Life was good. And thus began the summer of George. We won the Steve Case pitch competition, [Frameri partnered EnChroma](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/15/frameri-partners-with-enchroma-to-offer-fashion-eyewear-for-the-color-blind/)
, with a super cool company that made lenses that could correct color blindness. You may remember seeing them on Reddit. People cried when they saw color for the first time and many when viral. [We moved into a new office in the coolest part of town.](https://www.soapboxmedia.com/innovationnews/072914-Frameri-launches-in-new-OTR-office.aspx)


### üëì 

Product Development saw many hurdles. What we were doing had never been done before and for reasons we were finding out.


<!-- We ended up becoming leaders in the startup community. -->

### ü¶à 

Our Shark Tank episode aired in the spring of 2015 to a roaring applause in the local community and had a dismal response on our website. Traffic spiked, but sales did not. We got 1 order after pitching our product to millions of people.

# üå®Ô∏è 2015

We used momentum from TV apperance to generate buzz around our store. It worked very well.

# üå∑ 2016

We made a big bet that we couldn't make pay off in time.

We built some cool things. For some reason we kept redesigning the website. This was a good instance of it.

I built some cool stuff at Frameri. We designed a very complex lens selector for the eCommerce website that displayed exactly what your glasses would look like. We incorrectly assumed that people really cared about this. They do no. The most important thing for people when buying glasses is someone that stands next to them and tells them they look good.

### üî® **Product Development**

---

I worked along side a good friend to redesign our homepage based purely on user feedback. The result was elegant, simple, easy to understand, and we promptly did another redesign based on the brand. 

Our site had a "virtual try on" feature that was a pain in the ass to implement and was not high quality. We just missed the recent boom of amazing AR technology. It would have saved the company.

The city of Cincinnati treated us very well. 


At the end of the day, I'm proud of what we built. We built a great team, our customers loved us, and I had fun. What more could you ask for? 

### üî® **Product Development**

I mean besides money. You could ask for money. Which we did ask for. Looking back it's kinda sad how little we would have needed to survive. Oh well.
