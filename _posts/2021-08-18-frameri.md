This is story about starting my first company. 



# üåû we meet

One hot Chicago night in **2013**, I received an email with the subject line "You have a new message in your founder2be.com inbox" I thought to myself oh great, someone else wants to pitch me their lame busines idea. Most of them were dog food delivery services for some reason. And the website wasn't much better. To give you an idea, the body of that email simply said "Please log in to view the messages in your inbox." I'll give the site one more chance I thought. Instead of a long boilerplate message with my name at the top, it said "Hey I'm in Chicago this weekend, let's grab beers and I'll tell you about the eyewear company I want to start." It began one when my co-founder Konrad and I met on one of those entrepeneur dating websites. He was lookin for a techncal co-founder, I was looking for a non-technical co-founder. A perfect match. 

<!-- We got accepted into [The Brandery](https://www.mainstventures.org/brandery-portfolio), a summer long tech accelerator based in Cincinati. I figured worst case scenario it completely flops and I meet some cool people. Easy decision. I made great lifelong friends and event the dog I lived became famous. -->

<!-- **2013** -->

# indiegogo

The Brandery program ended in the fall of 2013 and had enough traction (and money) to keep barreling forward. 

Still too early to raise a seed round, we launched a crowdfunding campaign on [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/frameri-one-lens-many-frames) because Kickstarter did not allow eyewear. That took A TON OF WORK getting the word out. We launched a "design competition" at the same time to boost interest and it actually worked. We got some interesting entries. The campaigned raised $63,000 and gave us confidence people wanted our product. Investors liked this very much.


# üåû Launch
 <!-- **2014** -->

We officially launched the company on July 29, 2013 when the wonderful [Jordan Cook wrote about us in Techcrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2014/07/29/frameri-eyes-up-warby-parker-launches-eyewear-with-interchangeable-lenses). We were the cool kid in school and everyone likes the cool kid. And thus began the summer of George. We won the Steve Case pitch competition, [Frameri partnered EnChroma](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/15/frameri-partners-with-enchroma-to-offer-fashion-eyewear-for-the-color-blind/)
, with a super cool company that made lenses that could correct color blindness. You may remember seeing them on Reddit. People cried when they saw color for the first time and many when viral. 


[We got a dope new office in the coolest part of town.](https://www.soapboxmedia.com/innovationnews/072914-Frameri-launches-in-new-OTR-office.aspx)


## Product Development

Did not go smoothly. What we were doing had never been done before and for reasons we were finding out.


We ended up becoming leaders in the startup community.

Our Shark Tank episode aired in the spring of 2015 to a roaring applause in the local community and had a dismal response on our website. Traffic spiked, but sales did not. We got 1 order after pitching our product to millions of people.

We used the momentum from TV apperance to generate buzz around our store. It worked very well.

The ECP partnership was our big bet that we couldn't make pay off in time.

I built some cool stuff at Frameri. We designed a very complex lens selector for the eCommerce website that displayed exactly what your glasses would look like. We incorrectly assumed that people really cared about this. They do no. The most important thing for people when buying glasses is someone that stands next to them and tells them they look good.

I worked along side a good friend to redesign our homepage based purely on user feedback. The result was elegant, simple, easy to understand, and we promptly did another redesign based on the brand. 

Our site had a "virtual try on" feature that was a pain in the ass to implement and was not high quality. We just missed the recent boom of amazing AR technology. It would have saved the company.

The city of Cincinnati treated us very well.

Reddit quietly publishes r/place and begins the coolest social experiment. 


## üìÜ 2018

At the end of the day, I'm proud of what we built. We built a great team, our customers loved us, and I had fun. What more could you ask for?

I mean besides money. You could ask for money. Which we did ask for. Looking back it's kinda sad how little we would have needed to survive. Oh well.
