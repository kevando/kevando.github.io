Pepe is one of the most classic internet memes. I believe it became so
popular because sad pepe emotes sadness so clearly.

Over time people created so many variations of sad pepe that when a new one
came around, it got dubbed a "rare pepe." Replace rare with scarce and you
can start to see why Pepe on the blockchain makes sense.

I learned about [rarepepes the digital trading card](https://avc.com/2017/05/rare-pepe)
and followed Fred's instructions to get my own.
