For anyone registering a domain, I highly recommend using [Google Apps.](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/products.html) They offer gmail interface, google docs, google calendar, an awesome dashboard to manage everything, and a great community to help support any issues. They even gave you 50 users before you needed to pay!

However, on December 6th, 2012&nbsp;[Google decided to no longer offer Google Apps for free](http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=2855120). This came as quite a shock to many users because several start ups run their business on Google Apps. Luckily they let everyone grandfather in with their old agreements, but all new accounts need to pay. The free or "standard edition" no longer exists.&nbsp;

You can still get Google Apps for fee, however it's a little tricky. They do not mention Google Apps is still free for a single user, but follow these steps and you can get it.

1)&nbsp;[Sign up like normal](http://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/). Only this time, you're going to sign up for a "free trial." Enter all your information and pay the $12 (as of April 2013) to register the domain for a year. While I don't like GoDaddy, I prefer them to enom. Either choice works.

2) You just registered for&nbsp;30 days with Google Apps Business Free Trial. I like to set a calendar reminder, but in 30 days Google will send you an email like this telling you that your account is suspended.

3)&nbsp;Log into your account and you should get prompted with this message.&nbsp;**Click "Fix this"**

4) **C****lick cancel** on the next screen.

5) Check the downgrade option and **click the continue button**

6)&nbsp;It might seem like you did something wrong, but you're now good to go with you're free single user Google Apps account!

7) One last thing.

You might also want to [create email aliases](http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=182527), or configure so that any email comes to your address. You won't be able to send mail with multiple accounts, but this way you could still put contact@domain.com and sales@domain.com on your website to give the illusion you have many email accounts.

I hope this helps someone. Leave a comment if you have any problems following these steps
